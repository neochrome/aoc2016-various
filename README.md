## Pre-requisites
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is used to facilitate the
multitude of languages and their dependencies without having to
install everything locally.

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) is used to orchestrate
building and running each day's solution.

## Usage
From the top-level folder issue `make` or `make all` in order to build and run
all days.

To run a separate day, enter the corresponding subfolder and issue `make`
or `make all`.
